<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised at the attention that my <a href="../../../abstracts/2017_hughey_machine">recent paper</a> in Genome Medicine has received. Paul Govern at VUMC News and Communications was the first to show interest in the work, and he asked a lot of great questions before writing his <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2017/03/02/study-reveals-circadian-time-in-a-blood-sample">article</a>. I had fun writing the <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2017/02/27/machine-learning-around-the-clock">blog post</a> for BioMed Central, which if nothing else, helped my family understand what the paper is about. And to think, this is a paper I almost didn’t write, because I wasn’t sure it would be interesting.</p>
