<p>And I’m looking for great people to join the team! We’re currently at population one: me. To be fair, we had a population of two during the summer, because Jarrod Shilts was tearing it up analyzing circadian gene expression in human cancer.</p>

<p>If you’re hard-working, enthusiastic, and <em>&lt;insert more positive adjectives here, but not too many&gt;</em> and interested in using computation to understand biology and improve human health, particularly in the context of circadian rhythms and sleep, please <a href="/join/">get in touch</a>!</p>

<p>Hopefully now it won’t feel so weird having that “hughey_lab” folder on my computer.</p>
