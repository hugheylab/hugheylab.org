<p>ΔCCD (delta clock correlation distance) is a method to infer the progression of the mammalian circadian clock based on the co-expression of circadian clock genes. ΔCCD can be applied to datasets in which the samples are not labeled with time of day and were not acquired throughout the 24-h cycle.</p>
