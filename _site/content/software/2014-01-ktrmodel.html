<p>The kinase translocation reporters convert changes in kinase activity to changes in nuclear:cytosolic localization, which makes the dynamics of kinase signaling easier to observe by live, single-cell imaging. To quantify the relationship between kinase activity and KTR localization, we developed a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations. We parameterized the model for JNK KTR in NIH3T3 cells.</p>
