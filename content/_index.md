title: Our Research
---

We use diverse computational methods and big data to understand how multi-scale biological systems behave over time. We are particularly interested in the system of circadian clocks throughout the body. With support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, we are developing and applying new tools to better understand the circadian system and how it interacts with the environment and other physiological processes to influence human health.

We strive to make the products of our research freely available. This includes the published articles, the underlying data and software code, and where possible, the pre-publication peer reviews. In our experience, this reproducibility and transparency helps us do good science. Hopefully it also makes it easier for others to build on our work.
