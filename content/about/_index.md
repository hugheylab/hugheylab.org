title: About
---

The design for this website is based on the lab sites of [Trevor Bedford](bedford.io) and [Premal Shah](theshahlab.org). The fonts are the same ones used by [Cole Trapnell's site](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io).

Whereas those sites are built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), this site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The port from Jekyll to Hugo was done by the outstanding [Taras K](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~~c918fe28bc506156).

The [source code](https://gitlab.com/hugheylab/hugheylab.gitlab.io) is freely available under the MIT license. If you use the code in your own site, I'd appreciate a link back to [hugheylab.org](hugheylab.org).
