I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Hughey, Johnson, and McMahon Labs. I received my BS in Behavioral Neuroscience from Northeastern University in 2012, and my PhD in Neuroscience from Vanderbilt University in 2019.

My research is focused on circadian biology, particularly on the lasting effects of different types of light exposure on the circadian system of mammals. While as an experimental biologist I spend time addressing questions at the behavioral, physiological, and cellular levels, I am also passionate about building reliable, specialized analysis tools for researchers in my field.

Beyond science, I spend my time playing hockey and tennis, baking and cooking, and completing and constructing crossword puzzles.
