Primarily wet-lab research experience in undergrad, along with programming courses and programming experience through personal projects in my free time. Just finished two great dry-lab rotations in computational genetics in the labs of Jennifer Below and Doug Ruderfer. Interested in using data, programming, and technology to answer scientific questions in healthcare and other biological realms, and to revolutionize how we use genetic information.
