I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Hughey Lab and the Department of Biomedical Informatics. I joined the lab in August 2018 after completing my PhD in Chemistry here at Vanderbilt.

My research interests are in applying computational methods to solving practical research problems. This ranges from a simple correlation with biological activity of drug compounds, to complex machine learning models of patient treatment success. I am also passionate about science outreach and creating easy to understand visualizations. 

For my Ph.D. research, I worked with Jens Meiler on modeling interactions between proteins and small molecule ligands. My B.S. is in Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry from the University of California, San Diego. It was there when I first learned about computational modeling and its application to biological problems. 

Outside of work, I am an avid tennis and soccer fan/player. I love playing around with random datasets on everything from sports to the Supreme Court. I will also accept any trivia or board game challenges.
