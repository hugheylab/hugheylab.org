I'm an Instructor of Biomedical Informatics in the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Despite the title, my primary responsibility is research.

My goal is to do excellent science, to communicate it clearly, and to help my mentees do the same. That's hard. Fortunately, I've been surrounded by great scientists, communicators, and mentors at every stage of my career. I even have one at home ([pilot](https://faculty.mc.vanderbilt.edu/Faculty/Details/40135)).

As an undergraduate, I studied Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics. I also did research in the lab of [John Wikswo](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/viibre/wikswo.php), developing microfluidic devices to study signaling dynamics in single immune cells.

I then went out to the Bay Area and worked with [Markus Covert](https://www.covert.stanford.edu), where I applied a combination of live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling to understand the dynamics of innate immune signaling. They eventually gave me a PhD in Bioengineering.

I then did a postdoc with [Atul Butte](http://buttelab.ucsf.edu), where I learned to apply computational methods to publicly available data for basic discovery and clinical translation. Here is where I began to focus on circadian rhythms as a dynamic system that drives multiple facets of human physiology.
