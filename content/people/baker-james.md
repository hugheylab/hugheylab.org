I am a first-year graduate student in the Quantitative and Chemical Biology program at Vanderbilt. I received my B.S. in chemistry and biochemistry from NC State in 2019. I am interested in bioinformatics and using computational methods to make inferences from data.

My undergraduate research consisted of two parts. I spent one year synthesizing Meridianin D analogues and testing these compounds on various biofilms. I then spent a summer at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center researching the synthesis of adjacent chiral centers on indoline compounds through protodeborylation.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar and hammered dulcimer, cycling, cooking, and reading.
