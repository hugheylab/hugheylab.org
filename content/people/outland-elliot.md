I earned my BS and MS degrees in Statistics in 2015 and 2020, respectively, from the University of Georgia. Between undergrad and graduate school, I worked as a business intelligence analyst for a healthcare software company. I'm interested in applying computational and statistical methods to draw inferences from data of all kinds. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading, and martial arts.
