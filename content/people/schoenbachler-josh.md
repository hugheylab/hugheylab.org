I was a Full Stack Developer with a primary focus on back end for 2.5 years before joining the lab. I am incredibly interested in the future of computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications. I love solving complex problems using technical solutions, and really enjoy solving problems on Project Euler when I get the chance.
