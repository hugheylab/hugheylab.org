I'm an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics and Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt.

My goal is to do excellent science, to communicate it clearly, and to help my mentees do the same. That's hard. Fortunately, I've been surrounded by great scientists, communicators, and mentors at every stage of my career. I even have one at home ([pilot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jencolby)).

As an undergraduate, I studied Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics. I also did research in the lab of [John Wikswo](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/viibre/wikswo.php), developing microfluidic devices to study signaling dynamics in single immune cells.

I then went out to the Bay Area and worked with [Markus Covert](https://www.covert.stanford.edu), where I applied a combination of live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling to understand the dynamics of innate immune signaling. They eventually gave me a PhD in Bioengineering.

I then did a postdoc with [Atul Butte](http://buttelab.ucsf.edu), where I learned the wonder of applying computational methods to publicly available data to address basic biological questions and clinical needs. The learning process continues to this day. During my postdoc is when I began to focus on using computation to study circadian rhythms.
