I'm a sophisticated, enthusiastic, and [highly accomplished](http://www.dogshowscores.com/dogs/DN33239206) Bouvier des Flandres. I'm originally from Wisconsin. Some people say I'm kind of small for a Bouvier, but actually I conform perfectly to the breed standard.

I have an exemplary circadian rhythm, and always politely notify my people when it is time to wake up, eat, or do something fun.
