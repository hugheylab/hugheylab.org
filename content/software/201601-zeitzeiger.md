ZeitZeiger is a method for regularized supervised learning on high-dimensional data from an oscillatory system. ZeitZeiger relies on periodic smoothing splines and sparse principal components. ZeitZeiger can quantify rhythmic behavior, make accurate predictions, identify major patterns and important features, and detect when the oscillator is perturbed.
